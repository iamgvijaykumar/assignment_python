## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
	Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing,
	very high level dynamic data types, and classes
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
	In Python language we do not need to declare the type of the variables, it will automatically states the variable in runtime. 
	It will take care of the Memory Mangement as well.  
Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
	PROS: 
		Easy to learn and understand
		Open Source
		Large community support
		Various Libraries
		Interpreter
		
	Cons:
		 Since Python is interpreted, it often results in slow execution.
		 Python is much rarely seen on the client-side.		

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
	Web Development
	Gaming
	Data Science, AI, ML
	OS development	

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
	Variables are containers for storing data
		foo = "Hello World"
		bar = 43

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
	name = input('What is your name: ')

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
	string

Q8. What is type casting?
	type casting is to change the data type of a variable(for eg: int to float)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
	yes, We can use looping statements(recursive and non resursive) fon n-number of times or until the condition is satisfy
	
Q10. What are keywords?
	Keywords are special resevred words for the programming language, which we cannot use

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
	No, The keywords are already avaliable to program to perform specific tasks(eg: if, class, elif)

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
	Indentatiion is nothing but spaces, where in Python it's used indicate the block of code

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
	1. using print statement: print()
	2. using raise keyword, raise TypeError('Only integers are allowed')	

Q14. What are operators in Python?
	operators perform specific task on variables and values
		Arithmetic operators
		Assignment operators
		Comparison operators
		Logical operators
		Identity operators
		Membership operators
		Bitwise operators

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
	/ - float division
	// - integer division

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
		value = 'iNeuron'
		opvalue = value*4
		print(opvalue)
		
		or
		
		print('iNeuron'*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
	userInput = input('Enter a number: ')
	if (userInput % 2 == 0):
		print('your entered number ->',userInput,'is EVEN number'  )
	else:
		print('your entered number ->',userInput,'is ODD number'  )

Q18. What are boolean operator?
	and, or and not are referred to as boolean operators with give true or false

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 - 1
 
0 and 0 - 	0

True and False and True - false

1 or 0 or 0 - 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
	if, if elif, nested if elif are the conditional statements to perform operations on true or false(decision making)
	

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
	if, if elif, nested if elif are the conditional statements to perform operations on true or false
	else will be the last of the conditional statement

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

	userAge = input('Enter your Age')
	if(userAge >= 18):
		print(I can vote)
	else:
		print(I can't vote)
		

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum = 0
for num in numbers:
    sum += num
print(sum)

```

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
	num1 = input('Enter first number')
	num2 = input('Enter second number')
	num3 = input('Enter third number')
	
	max = num1

	if(num2 > max):
		max = num2
	if(num3 > max):
		max = num3
		
	print('max number is', max)
	
	

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for num in numbers:
    if(num >= 500):
        break
    if(num >= 150):
        continue
    if((num % 5) == 0):
        print(num)
```
